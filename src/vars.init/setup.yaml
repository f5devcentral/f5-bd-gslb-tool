# A given Openshift/K8s deployment might have one or more routers, and we will
# assign a diferent name for each (dRouter for short). 
#
# Topology variables are indexed by these dRouter names.
#
# apiEndpoint:   Contains the URL of the apiEndpoint of each dRouter. Deployments with
#                several routers will have the same URL for different dRouters.

# publicAddress: Contains the public IP address (host names should not be used) of each dRouter that will be load balanced
#                by the F5 Cloud Services DNS LB. This IP is unique for each dRouter.
